# Dot-Net-Banking-Api

Hello everyone, and thank you for visiting my .NET Banking API project!

This project consists of an API built with .NET Core 8, designed using a three-tier architecture. Its primary goal is to serve the needs of a home banking application. This architecture is composed of the following layers:

- Database Tier: Handles CRUD operations in the database and is the only layer with permission to read and modify data.
- Business Tier: Communicates with the database tier, processes retrieved data, and applies business logic and validations.
- Presentation Tier: Interacts with the business tier and performs the necessary operations to meet the specific requirements of the client application.

**For more information about each layer, open the documentation folder**
